# III Openathon Custom Software Engineering

![III Openathon Custom Software Engineering](https://github.com/Accenture/openathon-2019-appian/raw/master/images/CSE.png "III Openathon Custom Software Engineering")

You are welcome to a new **Openathon** edition organized for the **Accenture
Technology - Custom Software Engineering community** where, once again, we will
have the opportunity to discover, in a practical way, the possibilities offered
by the different architectures and leading frameworks in the market.

This edition will focus on Appian's BPM.  Using its development tools, we'll
create a cloud application that will allow users to interact with business
processes, decision making, real-time result analysis and task automation.
All this with the additional goal of discovering what a low-code platform can
offer to simplify the development of applications, make it faster and simpler,
and adapt to the needs of our clients in an agile way.
